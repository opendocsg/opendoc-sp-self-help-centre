## (2) Operating under highly secured networks or strict IT policy

- **DESCRIPTION/PROBLEM** 

Some users might be attempting registration/payment using a company issued notebook or device which may be heavily controlled in terms of technical features and configuration. This will prevent you from enabling pop-ups/cookies.

You are also advised not to attempt any registration or payment while being connected to either a highly secured network or a network which has strict IT policy e.g. firewall configurations etc. This is because our online services may be affected under such conditions.

You should be able to overcome this by simply:
* connecting to your own personal internet network

* using a smartphone or tablet connected on mobile data.

If you are required to do the registration officially using your company issued notebook or device, please send in a request for a direct registration link by contacting us at the PACE Hotline at 6772 1288 or email to pace@sp.edu.sg.
