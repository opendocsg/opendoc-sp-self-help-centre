# How to use Microsoft Teams

Microsoft(MS) Teams is a unified communication and collaboration platform that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration. 

If your lecturer/trainer has invited you to join a session using MS Teams, please log in to your iChat account before joining any online meeting invitation.

If you do not have the software, you may login to your Microsoft account portal and download it. SP staff should download using the Software Center app.
