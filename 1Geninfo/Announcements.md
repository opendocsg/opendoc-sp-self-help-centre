## Status of PACE Progammes/Courses

Given the current COVID-19 situation, the PACE Academy will be moving our programmes and courses onto e-learning mode. However, for certain affected programmes and courses, we may issue a notice for postponement or cancellation.

Our programme administrators will be communicating on these alternative arrangements to all trainers, students and participants accordingly.
