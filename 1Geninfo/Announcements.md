## (2) Status of PACE Progammes/Courses

Given the current COVID-19 situation, the PACE Academy will be moving most of our programmes and courses onto e-learning or online instruction mode. However, for certain affected programmes and courses, we may issue a notice for postponement or cancellation.

As to how the Circurit Breaker measures are being eased, the academy may be allowed to offer classroom based courses again, albeit with restrictions to ensure safety.

Our programme administrators will be communicating on these alternative arrangements to all trainers, students and participants accordingly.
