# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What can I do if I had provided the wrong information during registration?

We would be able to assist you to amend any of these information after making a registration:

1) Full Name

2) Mailing address

3) Email address

4) Mobile No.

etc.

by submitting a change request via our [online e-form](https://sp-pace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012690473-Electronic-Forms).

Depending on your course, we may also assist to convert the application type i.e. from corporate to individual vice versa).

However, we will not be able to change your NRIC/FIN/Passport number once it has been recorded in our system during registration, as it is the primary record of information. You are advised to make another registration with the correct information as well as payment.

Please note that transfer of applications from one individual to another individual is also not possible.

The above notwithstanding, please note that all requests and appeals thereof are subjected to approval and further verification if so required, and our decision is final.
