## Making a Withdrawal/Cancellation

## (i) How to withdrawal/cancel a registeration?

You may withdraw from a course/programme or cancel a registration at any time by submitting the [Withdrawal Form](https://www.sp.edu.sg/docs/default-source/content-migration-docs/content-migration/126-pace-frm-126-02-course-withdrawal-refund-form-ver4-0-pdf8ea3279a9a5f47dd84f6888af7c572c9.pdf) to the PACE Academy.

## (ii) Considerations before withdrawing/cancelling a registration

However, there may be consequences following a withdrawal/cancellation:

(1) If payment was made/received, you will be refunded according to the following, based on when the Withdrawal Form is received:
* 2 weeks before the commencement of the course - 100% (full) refund
* Less than 2 weeks before commencement of the course - 70% (partial) refund
* On or after date of commencement - 0% (no) refund

(2) For certain courses/programmes, you may no longer be eligible for the same subsidies if you wish to resume.
(3) Having made the withdrawal/cancellation, you will no longer be able to complete or continue with the rest of the course/programme.
(4) For all courses/programmes, you will not be placed on a priority list to be offered a placement should you decide to resume. (You will be required to make another registration/payment accordingly)
(5) For part time diploma/post diploma students, you may make a withdrawal and resume to complete the programme within the candidature period, subject to module and placement availability. **We do not have a deferment policy.** These students must write in to ptenquiry@sp.edu.sg before the start of the upcoming semester if they wish to re-join/ continue with the programme.

NB: Refund may take up to 6-8 weeks.
